# This is where you put your own keybinds. Be Mindful to check as well ~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf to avoid conflict
# if you think I should replace the Pre-defined Keybinds in ~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf , submit an issue or let me know in DC and present me a valid reason as to why, such as conflicting with global shortcuts, etc etc

# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Keywords/ for more settings and variables

#  IMPORTANT: If you want to remap and existing keybind you MUST unbindd it first 

# The bindings are CASE SENSITIVE. We suggest you copy the exisitng binding here
#  Then change `bindd` to `unbind`

# E.g. 
# unbind = $mainMod, Return, Open terminal, exec, $term
# bindd = $mainMod, Return, Open terminal, exec, ghostty 
#
# unbind = $mainMod, E, file manager, exec, $files
# bindd = $mainMod, T, file manager, exec, $files

# If you are ADDING a bindd, make sure you include the description 
# Other the keybind search menu might not show it properly 

# E.g.
# bindd = $mainMod, Z, My z app, exec APPNAME
